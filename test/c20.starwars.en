Star Wars is an 
American epic space 
opera franchise, 
centered on a film 
series created by 
George Lucas. It 
depicts the 
adventures of 
various characters 
"a long time ago in 
a galaxy far, far 
away".

The franchise began 
in 1977 with the 
release of the film 
Star Wars (later 
subtitled Episode 
IV: A New Hope in 
1981),[2][3] which 
became a worldwide 
pop culture 
phenomenon. It was 
followed by the 
successful sequels 
The Empire Strikes 
Back (1980) and 
Return of the Jedi 
(1983); these three 
films constitute the 
original Star Wars 
trilogy. A prequel 
trilogy was released 
between 1999 and 
2005, which received 
mixed reactions from 
both critics and 
fans. A sequel 
trilogy began in 
2015 with the 
release of Star 
Wars: The Force 
Awakens. All seven 
films were nominated 
for Academy Awards 
(with wins going to 
the first two films) 
and have been 
commercial 
successes, with a 
combined box office 
revenue of over $7.5 
billion,[4] making 
Star Wars the third 
highest-grossing 
film series.[5] 
Spin-off films 
include the animated 
Star Wars: The Clone 
Wars (2008) and 
Rogue One (2016), 
the latter of which 
is the first in an 
upcoming series of 
anthology films.

The series has 
spawned an extensive 
media franchise 
including books, 
television series, 
computer and video 
games, and comic 
books, all of which 
take place within 
the same continuity 
as the films, 
resulting in 
significant 
development of the 
series's fictional 
universe, with the 
non-canonical works 
falling under the 
defunct Star Wars 
Legends label. Star 
Wars also holds a 
Guinness World 
Records title for 
the "Most successful 
film merchandising 
franchise. In 2015, 
the total value of 
the Star Wars 
franchise was 
estimated at USD $42 
billion,[6][7] 
making Star Wars the 
second 
highest-grossing 
media franchise of 
all time.
